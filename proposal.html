      <h2>Government of Canada, The Face Behind The Mask</h2>
    </hgroup> 

    <article>
      <h4>This is a parody website of the official Canadian government. Our government has spent a lot of resources to make Canada look like a beautiful country filled with nice people. A place where everyone says sorry, and where the people in power care about their citizens. This is merely just a facade, and I wanted to expose the other side of the coin in a satirical way.</h4>

      <p>Canada is a great place to do business while the government is the only true one who benefits from it. The large majority of everything that is bought on the land is taxed up to 33%. This means anyone who wants to buy almost anything they wish definitely can but will pay almost 33% on top of its actual price to go back to the government for its activities and ‘duties’. These activities and duties are not that great, such as the health care system; which is not available for free to all of the population even if all of the population contributes to paying for it (Government of Canada).</p>

      <p>Another system the Canadian government has disappointed, to say the least, its citizens with, is their passport renewal system. Its peak in disappointment seems to truly be in 2022. Post-COVID-19 harsh restrictions, the population started to save up a little and wanted to travel as it used to before COVID-19, and had finally broken loose in the country. For many, if not most, of the population seeking to renew their passports, they were refused to do so unless they had to leave the country within the next 48 hours. A passport renewed within 48 hours costs 250$ at that time. On top of most people having to come at least 3 times to be able to get inside the Canadian passport agency, many were forced to camp outside the night before to have that chance happen. For all the stars to be aligned, it sometimes took 10 times to come in person to finally get your passport and leave the same day.</p>

      <p>Visa applicants will have their case scrutinized to the pore of their skin. That is to make sure anyone who comes in will work for the benefit of the country. This essentially follows Canada’s tradition of using cheap non-white labor to build wealth while taking advantage of their position of power. Moreover, many immigrants with a high level of education and diplomas cannot practice their jobs based on the country they graduated from. What a coincidence that these countries also happen to be the ones with darker-skinned people (Proudfoot).</p>

      <p>Canadians have had this reputation of being “smart, caring forward-looking,” and backed by a liberal government led by “the right leader” (Doucet). Whether it is because of its “right” government or its iconic and gorgeous landscapes, Canada shines on the international front. Conveniently speaking the face of their success is not someone of color or rarely, not to say never, been a person of color either. The whole country is however built on the First Nations population's blood sweat and tears. It is immigrants that later follow through with the building often disregarding their qualifications (Wong).
      </p>

      <p>Generally speaking, Canada sounds great with the fact that they offer a strong passport, opportunities, and access to health care. These are all snippets of great things in theory but painful to live in practice. The contrast between what is advertised and what happens can be too drastic when it comes to what Canada has to offer.</p>
